## Project Instructions

• Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs – present.

• Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage)

• Examine Irish context:

    o Climate change signals: (see Maynooth study: The emergence of a climate change signal in long-term Irish meteorological observations - ScienceDirect)
    
• Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas dataframe and export to csv and json formats

• For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis).

• Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue 

• Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature/polar-ice- coverage
